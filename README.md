# Reflection

- using React is getting slightly easier, practice and repetition definetely helps.
- the small syntax errors are really annoying; i spent 2 hours rereading all of my code again and again only to find out the error was because i didnt capitalise my component.
- other the small errors that take ages to find and fix, i would say i understand the logic of it.
- tailwindcss was also very interesting, i found that bit quite fun
- i did get a bit lost as to where to put my code, i had a a few pages and components so i lost track of what to code where.
